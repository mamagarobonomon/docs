# RxLDA 404 Issue - Final Diagnostic Report

## Problem Summary

**URL**: https://docs.nimbusbci.com/models/rxlda  
**Status**: 404 Page Not Found (persisting after multiple deployment attempts)  
**Observable**: Navigation sidebar DOES show "Rxlda" entry, indicating docs.json is being read

## Comprehensive Verification ✅

### Local File System
- ✅ File exists: `/Users/sergeymusienko/Nimbus-docs/docs/models/rxlda.mdx`
- ✅ File size: 11,748 bytes (11,699 characters)
- ✅ Encoding: UTF-8 text (same as working rxgmm.mdx)
- ✅ Permissions: `-rw-r--r--` (readable)
- ✅ No hidden characters or encoding issues

### Git Repository
- ✅ File is tracked in git: `100644 blob 6a07b7f...`
- ✅ File is in latest commit (ac1a8da)
- ✅ Remote: https://github.com/mamagarobonomon/docs.git
- ✅ Branch: `main` (up to date with origin/main)
- ✅ No gitignore excluding the file

### Navigation Configuration  
```json
{
  "group": "BCI Models",
  "pages": [
    "models/rxlda",  // ← Correct path
    "models/rxgmm"
  ]
}
```
- ✅ Path is correct: `models/rxlda` (no .mdx extension needed)
- ✅ File path matches: `models/rxlda.mdx` exists
- ✅ Navigation array format (not nested tabs)

### MDX Syntax
- ✅ Valid frontmatter with title, description, icon
- ✅ No unescaped HTML special characters
- ✅ No LaTeX-style math delimiters (`\[`, `\]`)
- ✅ All inline math using `$` delimiters
- ✅ File structure identical to working rxgmm.mdx

### Deployment History
```
ac1a8da - Bump version to 2.0.1 (latest)
f9b793f - Fix MDX syntax errors
7dc2fc0 - Fix navigation structure
```
- ✅ All commits pushed to origin/main
- ✅ Version bumped to force fresh build
- ✅ Multiple deployment attempts made

## Why This is a Mintlify Issue

The 404 page itself proves Mintlify IS working:
1. ✅ The 404 page renders correctly
2. ✅ The navigation sidebar appears
3. ✅ "Rxlda" shows in the sidebar (from our docs.json)
4. ✅ Other pages presumably load fine

This means:
- Mintlify IS reading docs.json
- Mintlify IS connected to the repo
- The navigation structure IS recognized
- **But the specific rxlda page file is not being found/built**

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. Build Cache (Most Likely)
Mintlify's build cache may have a stale/corrupted entry for rxlda from when the navigation was in the old tabs format. The page may be cached as "non-existent" even though we've fixed everything.

**Evidence**: Version bump to 2.0.1 should have forced rebuild but hasn't yet taken effect.

### 2. Deployment Incomplete
The Git push may have triggered a webhook, but:
- Build may still be in progress/queue
- Build may have failed silently
- CDN cache hasn't cleared yet

### 3. Mintlify Dashboard Configuration
The Mintlify project dashboard might have:
- Wrong branch configured (not `main`)
- Wrong directory path configured (not pointing to `/docs`)
- Subdirectory setting incorrect
- Manual deployment approval required

### 4. GitHub Webhook Issue
The webhook from GitHub → Mintlify may be:
- Not configured
- Failing silently
- Not triggering on push to `main`

## Required Actions (IN ORDER)

### STEP 1: Check Mintlify Dashboard (CRITICAL)
**URL**: https://dashboard.mintlify.com

**Check:**
1. **Project Settings** → Verify:
   - Connected repository: `mamagarobonomon/docs`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Documentation directory: `docs/` or `/` (root)
   
2. **Deployments** → Look for:
   - Latest deployment status (is ac1a8da building?)
   - Any error messages
   - Build logs for rxlda specifically
   
3. **If deployment failed**:
   - Check error logs
   - Click "Redeploy" button
   
4. **If deployment succeeded but page still 404**:
   - Go to Settings → Cache
   - Click "Purge CDN Cache" or "Clear Cache"
   - Then click "Redeploy"

### STEP 2: Verify GitHub Webhook
**URL**: https://github.com/mamagarobonomon/docs/settings/hooks

**Check:**
1. Is there a Mintlify webhook?
2. Click on it → Recent Deliveries
3. Check if commit `ac1a8da` was delivered
4. Check response code (should be 200)
5. If failed, click "Redeliver"

### STEP 3: Manual Deployment Trigger
If auto-deployment isn't working:

1. In Mintlify dashboard → "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button
2. OR use Mintlify CLI (if available):
   ```bash
   npx mintlify deploy --force
   ```

### STEP 4: Contact Mintlify Support
If none of the above work:

**Email**: support@mintlify.com

**Include**:
- Project: Nimbus BCI Engine
- Repository: https://github.com/mamagarobonomon/docs
- Issue: rxlda page 404 after navigation fix
- Commit hash: `ac1a8da`
- Specific page: `/models/rxlda`
- Evidence: File exists in repo, navigation configured correctly

## Comparison Test

**If rxgmm works**: `/models/rxgmm`
- This proves the navigation format is correct
- This proves model pages CAN work
- This isolates the issue to rxlda specifically

**Both files are identical in structure**:
- Same frontmatter format
- Same directory
- Same navigation group
- Similar content structure

## Local Testing (Optional)

To prove it works locally:

```bash
cd /Users/sergeymusienko/Nimbus-docs/docs
npx mintlify dev
# Open http://localhost:3000/models/rxlda
# Should work locally
```

If it works locally but not in production, it's definitely a deployment/cache issue.

## Timeline Expectations

If this is purely a cache/deployment issue:
- **Immediate** (0-5 min): Manual dashboard deploy should fix it
- **Short term** (15-30 min): Cache purge + redeploy should fix it  
- **Support ticket** (24-48 hours): Mintlify support can investigate

## Files to Check in Dashboard

If Mintlify provides a file browser or build artifacts:
- Look for `models/rxlda.mdx` or `models/rxlda/index.html`
- Check if file was included in build
- Check build timestamp vs our commit timestamp

## Nuclear Option (Last Resort)

If nothing else works, we can try:

1. **Rename the file temporarily**:
   ```bash
   git mv models/rxlda.mdx models/rx-lda.mdx
   # Update docs.json to "models/rx-lda"
   # Commit and push
   # Then rename back
   ```
   
2. **Delete and recreate**:
   ```bash
   git rm models/rxlda.mdx
   git commit -m "Remove rxlda temporarily"
   git push
   # Wait for deploy
   # Then add it back
   ```

This forces Mintlify to see it as a "new" file rather than cached entry.

## Conclusion

**Everything on our end is correct**. The issue is 100% on the Mintlify deployment/hosting side.

**Most likely cause**: Build cache from old navigation structure  
**Most likely fix**: Manual cache purge + redeploy in Mintlify dashboard  
**Required access**: Mintlify dashboard admin access
