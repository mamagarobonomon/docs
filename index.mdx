_The AI engine for Brain-Computer Interface applications with reactive probabilistic inference._

Given neural signals and BCI models, Nimbus enables efficient probabilistic inference for real-time brain-computer interfaces. Built on RxInfer.jl for Bayesian inference, NimbusSDK.jl provides production-ready implementations of RxLDA and RxGMM models. The SDK uses reactive message-passing algorithms to generate ultra-low latency responses that adapt to uncertainty in neural data. Nimbus has been designed with a focus on performance, scalability, and maximum throughput for real-time BCI applications.

## Why Nimbus BCI

Many critical BCI applications, including assistive technologies, gaming interfaces, medical devices, and research platforms require continually solving inference tasks in sophisticated probabilistic models with thousands of neural signals. Often, the inference task in these applications must be performed in real-time with sub-20ms latency in response to streaming brain data.

Popular traditional BCI methods rely on deterministic classification approaches that cannot handle the inherent uncertainty in neural signals. These methods produce brittle, overconfident predictions that fail to adapt when brain states change or signal quality degrades. While machine learning approaches promise better performance, they typically require extensive training data and cannot provide the explainability needed for medical applications or the real-time performance required for responsive interfaces.

**Current BCI systems face fundamental limitations:**
- **High latency**: Standard BCI processing takes 200ms+ 
- **Poor uncertainty handling**: Deterministic outputs with no confidence measures
- **Limited adaptability**: Cannot adjust to changing brain states or signal quality
- **Scalability issues**: Performance degrades with multi-channel, high-bandwidth data

Nimbus aims to solve these challenges by providing **ultra-low latency probabilistic inference** (sub-20ms) that handles uncertainty naturally, adapts to changing conditions, and scales to thousands of neural channels while maintaining explainable, FDA-ready outputs. The NimbusSDK.jl Julia package provides two powerful Bayesian models (RxLDA and RxGMM) with batch and streaming inference capabilities.
