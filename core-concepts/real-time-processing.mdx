# Real-time Processing for BCI

Real-time performance is critical for brain-computer interfaces. Users expect immediate responses to their neural commands - any delay breaks the sense of direct neural control and degrades the user experience. NimbusSDK achieves 10-25ms inference latency, enabling truly responsive BCI applications.

## Why Latency Matters in BCI

### The 20ms Threshold

Research shows that for natural interaction, BCI systems need to respond within **20 milliseconds** of neural signal acquisition:

- **Motor BCIs**: Cursor control feels natural only with sub-20ms latency
- **Communication BCIs**: Real-time typing requires immediate character selection
- **Gaming BCIs**: Competitive gaming demands instant response to mental commands
- **Assistive BCIs**: Wheelchair control and robotic arms need immediate execution

<Warning>
Standard BCI processing pipelines take 200ms or more, creating a noticeable delay that breaks the illusion of direct neural control.
</Warning>

### Current BCI Latency Bottlenecks

Traditional BCI systems have multiple latency sources:

```
Signal Acquisition → Feature Extraction → Classification → Post-processing → Output
     ~10ms              ~50ms            ~100ms         ~40ms        ~10ms
                                    
Total: ~210ms (10x slower than needed)
```

**Major bottlenecks:**
- **Batch processing**: Waiting for signal windows (50-100ms)
- **Complex feature extraction**: FFTs, spatial filters, etc.
- **Inefficient classifiers**: SVMs, neural networks with high overhead
- **Post-processing**: Smoothing, voting, calibration steps

## Nimbus Real-time Architecture

### Streaming Inference Pipeline

NimbusSDK processes neural signals as continuous streams, not batches:

```
Neural Stream → Reactive Processing → Probabilistic Inference → Real-time Output
    ~1ms            ~5ms                    ~10-15ms            ~2ms

Total: 18-23ms (sub-25ms target achieved)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Streaming Data Processing

NimbusSDK handles continuous data streams efficiently:

```julia
using NimbusSDK

# Initialize streaming session
metadata = BCIMetadata(
    sampling_rate = 250.0,
    paradigm = :motor_imagery,
    feature_type = :csp,
    n_features = 16,
    n_classes = 4,
    chunk_size = 250  # 1 second chunks
)

session = init_streaming(model, metadata)

# Process chunks as they arrive - no waiting for full trials
for chunk in eeg_stream
    # Incremental processing - updates beliefs in ~15ms
    chunk_result = process_chunk(session, chunk)
    
    # Immediate feedback to user
    if chunk_result.confidence > 0.7
        provide_immediate_feedback(chunk_result.prediction)
    end
end

# Finalize with weighted voting across chunks
final_result = finalize_trial(session; method=:weighted_vote)
```

### Batch Processing for Offline Analysis

For offline analysis where latency isn't critical:

```julia
using NimbusSDK

# Process multiple trials efficiently
results = predict_batch(model, bci_data; iterations=10)

# Typical performance: 200 trials in ~5 seconds
# Average latency per trial: ~25ms
```

### Reactive Message Passing

**RxInfer.jl** reactive programming principles:

- **Event-driven**: Computation triggered by new data arrival
- **Incremental**: Only update affected parts of the factor graph
- **Non-blocking**: Asynchronous message updates
- **Memory efficient**: Bounded memory usage for streaming

### Memory Efficiency

Real-time systems must manage memory carefully:

- **Bounded memory**: Fixed memory usage regardless of runtime
- **Efficient data structures**: Optimized for sequential access
- **Minimal allocation**: Reuse memory buffers when possible
- **Low GC pressure**: Julia's memory management optimized for real-time

## Performance Optimizations

### Algorithmic Optimizations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sparse Factor Graphs">
    Most BCI models have sparse connectivity. NimbusSDK exploits this:
    
    - **Local updates**: Only affected nodes recompute
    - **Message caching**: Reuse previous computations
    - **Efficient scheduling**: Optimal update order
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Variational Inference">
    RxInfer uses variational message passing for fast approximate inference:
    
    - **Closed-form updates**: No sampling required
    - **Parallel computation**: Independent message updates
    - **Convergence guarantees**: Provably correct inference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Adaptive Precision">
    Adjust computational precision based on requirements:
    
    ```julia
    # RxLDA: Fast with shared covariance
    # RxGMM: More flexible with class-specific covariances
    
    # Choose based on accuracy/speed tradeoff
    model = accuracy_priority ? RxGMMModel : RxLDAModel
    ```

## Real-World Performance

### Benchmark Results

NimbusSDK consistently achieves sub-25ms latency for BCI applications:

|| Application Type | Signal Type | Features | NimbusSDK Latency | Typical Pipeline |
||-----------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
|| Motor Imagery   | CSP         | 16       | 15-20ms          | 180ms           |
|| P300 Detection  | ERP         | 12       | 12-18ms          | 150ms           |
|| Multi-class MI  | CSP         | 32       | 20-25ms          | 200ms           |
|| Binary MI       | CSP         | 8        | 10-15ms          | 120ms           |

### Scaling Characteristics

- **Feature count**: Linear scaling with number of features
- **Classes**: Minimal impact from 2-4 classes
- **Streaming**: Constant per-chunk latency
- **Batch**: Efficient parallel processing

<Note>
Performance measured on modern CPU (Intel i7 or equivalent). RxLDA is typically faster than RxGMM due to shared covariance structure.
</Note>

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Processing

For optimal latency, deploy NimbusSDK locally:

- **No network latency**: All processing on device
- **Predictable performance**: No cloud variability
- **Privacy**: Neural data stays local
- **Offline capability**: Works without internet

### System Requirements

**Minimum:**
- Julia 1.9+
- 4GB RAM
- Modern CPU (Intel i5 or equivalent)

**Recommended:**
- Julia 1.10+
- 8GB RAM
- Fast CPU (Intel i7 or equivalent)
- SSD for model loading

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Performance Metrics

Monitor system performance during inference:

```julia
using NimbusSDK

# Track performance with built-in metrics
tracker = OnlinePerformanceTracker(window_size=50)

for (pred, label, conf) in zip(predictions, true_labels, confidences)
    metrics = update_and_report!(tracker, pred, label, conf)
end

# Get comprehensive metrics
full_metrics = get_metrics(tracker, n_classes=4, trial_duration=4.0)

println("Accuracy: $(round(full_metrics.accuracy * 100, digits=1))%")
println("ITR: $(round(full_metrics.information_transfer_rate, digits=1)) bits/min")
println("Mean confidence: $(round(full_metrics.mean_confidence, digits=3))")
```

### Quality Assessment

Identify trials with poor signal quality:

```julia
using NimbusSDK

# Assess each trial's quality
quality = assess_trial_quality(results)

if !quality.confidence_acceptable
    @warn "Trial quality below threshold" quality.overall_score
    println("Recommendation: $(quality.recommendation)")
end

# Check if rejection is warranted
if should_reject_trial(confidence, 0.7)
    println("⚠️  Low confidence trial - consider rejecting")
end
```

<Tip>
Use quality assessment to identify when recalibration is needed or when environmental conditions are affecting signal quality.
